# Genome Exploration of _Canis lupus_

_Species and Genome Information_

Species: _Canis lupus_

NCBI Assembly accession: GCA_905319855.2

Assembly level: Chromosome

Genome source: NCBI

FASTA filename: Canis_lupus.fasta

Approximate file size: 2.45 GB

# Objective

The objective of this activity was to explore the Canis lupus genome assembly using Galaxy. The activity focused on examining basic assembly statistics, sequence lengths, the effect of filtering short sequences, and the presence of possible open reading frames (ORFs).

# Tools Used and Important Settings

**Part 2:** Fasta Statistics

The tool was used to obtain the total assembly length, number of sequences, minimum and maximum sequence length, mean sequence length, N50, L50, and GC content.

**Part 3:** Compute sequence length

This tool was used to determine the length of each FASTA sequence. The five longest sequences were identified and recorded.

# Important Results

The genome had a total assembly length of approximately 2.45 Gb. The scaffold N50 was 65.78 Mb, with an L50 of 15, while the longest scaffold was approximately 124.67 Mb. The GC content was 41.49%.

Filtering sequences below 10 kb did not change the main assembly statistics because the shortest sequence in the original assembly was already 16,690 bp. Therefore, there were no sequences below the 10-kb filtering cutoff.

The ORF analysis found 206 ORFs, with the longest being 3,441 bp. This demonstrated that genome sequences can contain regions that could potentially code for proteins, but an ORF is not automatically a real gene and requires additional evidence for confirmation.

# Short Interpretation

The results suggest that the Canis lupus genome assembly contains many long sequences, including very long scaffolds. The N50 and L50 values indicate that a large part of the genome is contained in a relatively small number of long scaffolds. The filtering experiment showed that sequences shorter than 10 kb were not present in the assembly, so removing them did not affect the main statistics. The ORF analysis showed that the genome contains regions that may potentially code for proteins, but these regions cannot automatically be considered real genes without additional evidence.

### Figure Captions (From Screenshots Folder)

Figure 1. Fasta Statistics results for the Canis lupus genome assembly. The tool was used to summarize the assembly by calculating statistics such as scaffold N50, L50, N90, L90, and the maximum sequence length.

Figure 2. Compute Sequence Length results for the Canis lupus genome assembly. The tool was used to determine the length of each sequence in the FASTA dataset.

Figure 3. Filter Sequences by Length results for the Canis lupus genome assembly. The tool was used to filter the FASTA sequences based on their length and retain sequences meeting the selected minimum length of 10 kb.

Figure 4. Fasta Statistics results after filtering the Canis lupus genome assembly. Sequences shorter than 10 kb were removed using the Filter Sequences by Length tool, and the Fasta Statistics tool was used to examine the resulting assembly.

Figure 5. Filter FASTA results for the ORF analysis. The Filter FASTA tool was used to select the Canis lupus sequence CAJNRB020000009.1, which was 194,203 bp long, from the 82 available sequences. One sequence was retained while 81 sequences were discarded for the ORF analysis.

Figure 6. The getorf tool was used as an ORF-finding tool to identify possible open reading frames (ORFs) in the selected Canis lupus sequence. Using a minimum ORF size of 300 bp, the tool identified 206 ORFs.
